▣▣▣Predicates▣▣▣
Predicates can be any verb with a truth value. For instance 'Loves' could be symbolized with the
letter L. 'Rides a bike' could be symbolized with R.

To say someone rides a bike, use a general letter such as x. This would look like Rx. Or if you
wanted to be really general you can say ∀xRx (All x's ride bikes!).

There is such a thing as two-three-(and so on)-place predicates as well -- called relational predicates.
Back to love, if there is some x and some y, then you could say Lxy to indicate the English equivalent "x loves y".
You can again make it more general and say ∃x∃yLxy which in English means "there is some x where x loves some y."

▣▣▣Naming Conventions▣▣▣
Like anything in English, Logic has its own naming conventions as well.
Names can be any lowercase letter from the beginning (a) to the middle of the alphabet(r).
Thus, if we aren't sick of the love example, now we can place real names for x and y. If s = Susie and
r = Roger, we can say Lsr to mean susie loves roger. If Roger is a ladies man, we could even say ∀xLxr to
mean that everyone in the universe of x loves Roger.

In addition, commmon nouns can replace specific names. The letter 'r' could equal Roosters, Roads, or whatever we'd
like.
