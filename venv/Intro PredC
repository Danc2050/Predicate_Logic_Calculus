▣ ▣ ▣ Predicate Calculus Intro ▣ ▣ ▣

Like propositional logic, we can form truth tables with predicates.
The benefit is -- we need learn only four new rules!

Consider the example below:

~Fa V ∃xFx, ∃xFx -> P ⊧ Fa -> P

1. ~Fa V ∃xFx       given
2. ∃xFx->p          given
3. | Fa             H
4. | ~~Fa           3, DN
5. | ∃xFx           1,4 DS
6. |P               2,5 MP
7. Fa -> P          3-6CI

Notice: We didn't use any new rules that weren't in our toolset.
However, there are four new rules you need to know that are detailed in this section.
