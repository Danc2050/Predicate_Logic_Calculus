▣▣▣Universal Elimination▣▣▣
When setting up a two-column proof table, to get to the conclusion, a useful tool is to substitute
a name letter in the place of a generalized quantifier. For example, take the below proof:
1. ∀x(Fx->Gx)   given
2. ∀xFx         given
3. Fa->Ga       1, UE
4. Fa           2, UE
5. Ga           3,4 MP
In this proof, we must get to conclusion Ga. However, the universal quantifier is "in our way" and
we need to substitute an actual instance of x in order to prove that Ga is a possible conclusion out
of the universe of x. We do this twice in this proof with the letter UE - which stands for
'Universal elimination'. Consider this a new tool to use when conducting two-column proofs with predicate
logic.

▣▣▣Universal Introduction▣▣▣
If we can eliminate a quantifier, surely we can bring it back into the proof, right? The process is the same
as universal elimination in reverse, but with one special condition: we must create a subproof (i.e., an assumption).
The assumption tell us one thing: that some statement is true for an arbitrary constant in our universe. Once a
subproof has begun, we can continue to use our previous rules on premises to verify this statement and introduce
our quantifier.
See the below proof as an example:

1. ~Fa            given
2. | ∀xFx         H
3. | Fa           1, UE
4. | Fa ^ ~Fa     2, UE
5. ~ ∀xFx         3,4 MP

Notice a few more requirements:
1. The name letter a does not appear in any other assumptions
2. The name letter does not appear in any other hypothesis prior to the line 2 hypothesis

A few rules that this example does not show are:
1. We must replace every instance of x when introducing a universal quantifier.
2. We may replace only one name letter when introducing a quantifier, with the exception that we must replace the
   leftmost occurance first (e.g., ∀xFax).
