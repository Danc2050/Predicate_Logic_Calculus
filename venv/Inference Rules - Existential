▣ ▣ ▣ Existential Inference Rules ▣ ▣ ▣

▣▣▣Existential Introduction▣▣▣
Existential is an easier introduction rule to follow than Existential. It contains all the same rules, with the
exception that:
1. It places no restrictions on previous occurances of any name letter in hypotheses or premises.
2. Only one name letter may be replaced if it is useful for your proof.
Thus, the following proof would be legal:
1. Fa ^ Ga      given
2. ∃x(Fx^Gx)    1, EI

▣▣▣Existential Elimination▣▣▣
Unfortunately, some complexity is introduced when we eliminate existential quantifiers! Like universal introduction,
we must make an assumption. Equally, the name letter must not occur in the proof.

Take the following example as what not to do.

1. ∀y∃yFyx          given
2. ∃yFya            1, UE
3. | Faa            H
4. | ∃xFxx          3, EI
5. ∃xFxx            2, 3-4 EE

Notice, that the name letter a on line 3, already occurs in line 2. Therefore, this breaks our previously stated rule
and this proof is invalid.
