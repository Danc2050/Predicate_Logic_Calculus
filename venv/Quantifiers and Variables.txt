▣▣▣ Quantifiers and Variables ▣▣▣
▣ Quantifiers come in two shapes and sizes : Universal and Existential. In English, the Universal quantifier means
"for all" or "for every". Likewise, the Existential quantifier means "for some" or "there is some" Rather than the
usual English words used, logicians and mathematicians exchange ∀ to mean 'for all' and ∃ to mean 'there is some'.

▣ So to say something like "There are some cookies on every table", one may define T = a table, C = a cookie, and say
∃x (Tx -> Cx). The subscript x implies a collection of objects -- called a universe. Universes can be any subscript
between the middle of the alphabet 'r' and the end 'z'.

▣ Another example, to say "There is someone loved by everyone in the universe" one could define L = is loved
loved by and say ∀y∃x(Lxy).

▣ Similarly, if one said ∀xPx (or, said another way ∀xP (x)) it would mean for every X in that universe, P would be true
-- no matter what P implies. One can also say it differently and reach logical equivalence -- indicated by the
bi-conditional sign ⇔ between the two statements. In this example, ¬∃x¬P (x) means the same thing logically. In English,
we would say "there is not some X where P(x) is not true".

▣ The same can be said when swapping the quantifiers. For instance, ∃xP (x) ⇔ ¬∀xP (x). In English: "there is some x such
that P of some x is true" is equivalent to "P(x) is not true for all of x".
