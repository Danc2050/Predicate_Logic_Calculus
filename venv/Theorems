▣▣▣Equivalencies▣▣▣
Equivalencies will make your life easier when writing two-column proofs -- even refutation trees. To make use of this,
remember back to the earlier tutorial on Quantifiers. Here we noted that to say "for all x" also implies "there is some
x" where some predicate is true. Here, we lay out all equivalencies for the reader to use for their own proofs:

1. ~∀x~Fx ⇔ ∃xFx
2. ~∀xFx ⇔ ∃x~Fx
3. ∀x~Fx ⇔ ~∃xFx
4. ∀xFx ⇔ ~∃x~Fx

An example proof below demonstrates some of these rules:

1. | ∀xFx^∃x~Fx)  H
2. | ∀xFx         1, Specialization
3. | ∃x~Fx        1, Specialization
4. |   |~Fa       H
5. |   | Fa       2, UE
6. |   | P ^ ~P   4,5 Contradiction
7. |P ^ ~P        3, 4-6 EE
8. ~(∀xFx^∃x~Fx)  1-7 NI
