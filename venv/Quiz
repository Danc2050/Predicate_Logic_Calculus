Answer the following true/false.
1 ∀xP (x) ⇔ ¬∃x¬P (x)
2 ∃xP (x) ⇔ ¬∀xP (x)
3 ∀x∃yP (x, y) ⇔ ∃y∀xP (x, y)
4 ∃! x p(x) ⇔ ∃ x (p(x) ∧ ∀ y ((x 6 = y) → ¬p(y))
Let the universe of discourse for the variable n be N (all integers ≥ 0) and p(n)=”n is prime” e(n)= ”n is even.”
5 ∀ n ∃ m ((¬e(n) ∧ n 6 = m) → e(n + m)) = For each odd natural number there is a different natural number sum of which two is even.
6 ∀ m ∀ n ((p(m) ∧ p(n) ∧ m 6 = 2 ∧ n 6 = 2) → e(m + n)) = Sum of any two prime numbers except the prime number 2 is even.
7 Answer the following multiple choice question: Universe of discourse for the variable x is all students.
C(x): x is taking CSE 260.
M(x): X is a CSE major.
∀x(M (x) ∧ C(x)) in English is
(a) Every student is a CSE major and they all are taking CSE 260.
(b) Every CSE student is taking CSE 260.
(c) None of the above.

Translate each of the following statements into logical expressions using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.
predicates:
C(x): x is a CSE 260 student
L(x): x loves music
Universe of discourse for the variable x is all students.
8 Every student loves music = ∀ x L(x)
9 No student loves music = ¬∀ x L(x)
10 Some students love music = L(x) ∀x
11 Every CSE 260 student loves music = ∀ x (C(x) → L(x))
12 Some CSE 260 students love music = ∃ x (C(x) → L(x))
